\textit{Software Engineer} \hfill 11/2023 - Present
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
    \item {\normalsize {Stockmanager and various other microservices - In Stock and Availability Team }
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Worked extensively with Spring and Angular frameworks to deliver scalable front-end and back-end solutions, including developing user-friendly UIs and robust services with over 90\% unit test coverage.
            \item Moved legacy Tomcat-based servers to a Kubernetes-based architecture and designed Jenkins pipelines for a seamless deployment process, reducing manual jar deployments. This improved deployment time from 30 minutes to 10 minutes using Docker-based containerized deployment.
            \item Worked with Microsoft SQL Server, CockroachDB, and CouchDB (SQL \& NoSQL). Reduced database overheads by migrating legacy queries to batched queries, significantly decreasing application crashes and reducing query wait times by 40\%.
            \item Led 3+ key client integrations for warehouse management, resolving stock discrepancies and providing hypercare support for resolving complex issues, while ensuring on-time delivery and smooth collaboration across various teams.
